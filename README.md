# AWP System
## Application to help manage repair inventory

This application allows repair technicians to check in a unit for repair, change status of each repair, and search tables for information

## Dashboard

Firstly users will be greeted with the dashboard screen which shows them the date, number of units awaiting parts, number of units in progress, and the number of repaired units

## Unit Check In

The "Unit Check In" screen allows users to check in a unit for repair. It prompts the user to input information about the service order, unit sku, part type, remarks (if necessary), part sku, model, and cart (allows unit to be quickly found). After they have inputed all of the information and can submit this ticket.

## Status Change/Edit/Delete

This screen allows users to change statuses of any of the repair id's if necessary. Also, below this form there is a delete record function if the user needs to drop record.

The "Edit Unit" prompt asks for the "Repair ID" that needs to be edited. When the desired id is inputed, the user will be redirected to the "Edit Unit" page. There the fields will be automatically filled with the appropriate information, and then the user can edit the needed information.

## Awaiting parts, In Progress, and Repaired
These screens shows the user the inventory that is either "awaiting parts", "in progress", or "repaired". Every table is searchable by "repair id", "service order", or by date. The "In Progress" screen and "Repaired" screen have a function to either change a repair id status to "IP" or to "Repaired".

Each table has a download function that downloads the present table on screen into a .csv file.
